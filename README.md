project about modelling gravitational waves propagating through space. Two languages were used to write these codes, namely python and matlab
these models are based on the theory of Einstein's general relativity and we basically explain what happens when two body of masses in space merge with one another, how the space around them is bent and those ripples are sent out through space and this project models the movement of those ripples. Gravitational effect animation code, contains 3 functions, the main functions which doesn't take any arguments, and doesn't explicitly return anything but initializes metrices and meshgrid to store values in. Then there are 2 helper functions, one is the Binary System with takes 5 inputs to create animations frames for a Binary system and another one is the deformation of spacetime which creates animation for the deformation of spacetime.
