project about modelling gravitational waves propagating through space.
two languages were used to write these codes, namely python and matlab
these models are based on the theory of Einstein's general relativity and we basically explain what happens when two body of masses in space merge with one another,
how the space around them is bent and those ripples are sent out through space and this project models the movement of those ripples.
